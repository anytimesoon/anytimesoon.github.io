Hi. My name is Damien. I've just quit my job in London, moved half way across the world to New York. 

I've decided to give up my physically demanding life of climbing truss and hanging lights and speakers for the more mentally challenging existence of a student learning to code. It wasn't taken lightly, but thanks to the support of the people around me, I think it's for the best.

Over the last 12 months, I've been preparing for this by learning Javascript. I tried my hand at Java for a little while, but that was a bit too verbose for me. It's probably something that will make sense to me a bit later on, but I got on a bit better with Javascript. Learn is now pushing ruby, and I think I like it too. It's very clean and doesn't look so much like a programming languange.

As for this blog, I'll be using it to explain all the new concepts I learn on my journey through the learn.co program. Enjoy :)
