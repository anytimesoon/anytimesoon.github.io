It's been a long time coming, but I've finally found the time to finish my project.

I started out thinking it would be a small image sharing site, but I was having so much fun with it that it kept growing and growing. Even now, I can think of a number of features that would be cool to add, but I need to get on with this course...

I decided to use devise and pundit for authentication/authorisation because I will want to make sure that once I start building my own websites, I can quickly deploy reliable authentication in my apps. I say 'quickly', but I spent quite a lot of time working on this aspect of it. It's good, though. I learned some of the tricky bits, so I feel more comfortable with it now.

I also wanted to learn how to use paperclip for projects I have lined up in the future. This is another interesting gem. I read alot about it, and I wasn't disapointed. It's very good for pictures, although I'm not sure how useful it would be for other file types. 

Everything else was just good old ruby on rails. I've been working on a PHP project lately, and it's so refreshing coming back to ruby. Everything is so nice :)
